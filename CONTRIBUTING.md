## Development Setup

### SDKs

Each SDK has its own setup instructions in its README:

- [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/rynko/sdk-node)

- [Java SDK](https://github.com/rynko/sdk-java)

### General Requirements

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

## Commit Message Format

We use conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```

```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high numbers
